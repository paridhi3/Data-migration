# âœ… G-Validate FAQs

### 1. What validation methods does G-Validate support?
G-Validate supports:
- **Cell-by-Cell Validation**
- **Test Case-Based Validation**

### 2. What is Cell-by-Cell Validation?
This method compares each individual data cell from the source to the corresponding cell in the target, generating a report that highlights mismatched rows and columns.

### 3. How does Test Case-Based Validation work?
It uses a CSV file containing SQL test cases and table names. These queries are executed on both source and target systems, and the results are compared to generate a pass/fail report.

### 4. Which validation method is faster?
**Test Case-Based Validation** is generally faster than Cell-by-Cell Validation because it avoids comparing every data cell, which is computationally intensive for large datasets.
